	- Were supposed to be teaching me rationality

During my time in this community, I've seen quite a bit of immoral, low-integrity behavior. If I bring to mind the five most disturbing people I've ever gotten to know, I met at least two through LessWrong and the Bay area rationalist scene. Some of it falls within normal ranges (I've regularly perceived moves like "lying about / misrepresenting prior beliefs to look smart"). Some of it, however, is more egregious. 

Of course, even granting my perceptions, every community has bad apples. So why leave? The short answer is "because LessWrong no longer feels like home." To expand:
1. The website-community (lack of virtue?)
2. Gross social dynamics (which have contributed in at least one case to an abusive work relationship),
3. Personal disillusionment,

In 2018, a friend told me that they "totally" could see me working at MIRI one day. At the time, I basked in the high praise. A month or so later, Buck Schlegeris interviewed me in case MIRI wanted to hire me immediately, but that didn't happen. At the time, I felt disappointed. Now, I feel relieved (even setting aside my sharp disagreements with prominent MIRI researchers). 

To understand why, consider that I used to idolize Eliezer Yudkowsky and Nate Soares.[^idol] Consider that in [date], I posted [link], my third-ever post on the website. It was a textbook review, directly inspired by Nate's self-study alignment journey. "If he could do it, so can I", I wagered. My post linked three times to Nate's "Replacing Guilt" blog posts, which I also loved. I respected the precision in his thinking

[^idol]: I was aware that idolization is bad, and I tried to tamp down on it. I didn't fully succeed.

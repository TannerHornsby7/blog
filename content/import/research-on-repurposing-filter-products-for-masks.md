A local organization is looking to produce masks for the hospital, and they reached out to me for guidance. Since this is outside of my expertise and I haven't been following all of the recent research, I'm passing the questions along here.

> We are looking for some valid research on the use of commercial products for face masks. We have a couple of designs that can fit over or have a pocket to insert an additional filter. I have found multiple sources online that refer to furnace filters, air filtration system filters, even HEPA vacuum bags, as ideal products to use to either completely comprise a face mask or be inserted into a pocket between layers of fabric to provide extra protection.

>
> • Could other materials be used to enhance the filter’s effectiveness, safety, smell, etc.? I have seen models that added an activated charcoal filter over the top, coffee filter, etc.? I have also heard that layers create a dispersion effect that increases the protective factor i.e. a thick bundled knitted scarf has a higher protective factor because of the density.

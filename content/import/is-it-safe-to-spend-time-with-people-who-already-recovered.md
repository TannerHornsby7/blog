I'm trying to evaluate the risks associated with spending time with someone who stopped showing symptoms over a month ago.

Most of what I can find is Very Serious Experts saying "No one knows for sure how long immunity lasts. You have to keep wearing masks, even if you've already recovered." The first claim seems misleading (there are [only a handful of reinfections](https://gulfnews.com/world/covid-19-5-confirmed-cases-of-sars-cov-2-reinfections-what-we-do-and-dont-know-1.1603024557748) in the whole world), but what about the second claim? [Could a recovered individual who previously tested negative be asymptomatic and still spread the virus](https://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/article/29/10/2020/Some-Covid-recovered-patients-can-still-carry-virus-Study)?

For months, I have built a new home for my online content: [`www.turntrout.com`](www.turntrout.com). I brooked no compromises. Over [1,350 commits later](https://github.com/alexander-turner/TurnTrout.com/commits/main/),[^commits] I'm ready to publicize.

[^commits]: Counted by running 
     ```shell
    git rev-list --author="alex@turntrout.com" --count main
    ```

Figure: I commissioned this GIF for $270.94. I paid a bit extra to ensure the goose honks twice. 

I don't want to be on LessWrong anymore. Briefly, the site - and parts of the rationality community - don't meet my standards for discourse, truth-seeking, charity, and community health. For the most part, I'll elaborate my concerns another time. This is a happy post. ‚ù§Ô∏è  

# Inspiration for the website
I am pleased to present the _initial release_ of `www.turntrout.com` - I have many, many more planned features.


![](https://assets.turntrout.com/static/images/posts/site_desktop.avif)
Figure: The site is most beautiful on the desktop. For example, the desktop enables hover previews for internal links. 

Many folks see the first <span class="dropcap" data-first-letter="D">d</span>ropcap and think of [`gwern.net`](https://gwern.net). While I appreciate `gwern`'s site, I didn't actively consult it for design - though it did inspire the dropcaps and hover previews for internal links. 

The serif font is the open-source [EB Garamond](https://github.com/georgd/EB-Garamond), inspired by e.g. the beautiful Garamond of [`ReadTheSequences.com`](https://readthesequences.com). However, most of this website's design was by my own taste.

Figure: Design comes naturally to me. I've loved SMALLCAPS and Garamond fonts for a long time, as seen in [my alignment PhD](/alignment-phd).

_The Pond_ makes me feel graceful and grateful and proud. It's my home, and I've worked hard towards perfection. I'll write a post about the technical abilities of the site, of my quality assurance measures, and of my CI pipeline. I have so much hope and so many plans for this website!

I hope this site encourages me to write more. I miss writing and sharing. I miss [feeling proud and grateful to be part of a community](/lightness-and-unease#forwards). This website will probably not turn into a community _per se_, because I don't plan to enable comments. But I still hope that when I write, and you read, and you [write _back_ with your thoughts](mailto:alex@turntrout.com) - I hope we can bond and exchange ideas all the same. 

# What you can find in _The Pond_

I've imported and remastered all 120 of my LessWrong posts. _Every single post_, retouched and detailed. I both [pin down my favorite posts](/posts#my-favorite-posts) and [group the posts into sequences](/posts#sequences). I've also launched the site with three extra posts! Brand new content! üéâ 
1. [Gradient routing: Masking gradients to localize computation in neural networks](/gradient-routing)
2. [Can transformers act on information beyond an effective layer horizon?](/effective-layer-horizon)
3. [Intrinsic power-seeking: AI might seek power for power's sake](/dangers-of-intrinsic-power-seeking) 

The [research page](/research) summarizes my past and present research interests, along with short retrospectives on the older areas. 

## My dating doc!

Like any good trout seeking a mate, I've prepared my nesting grounds with care. While (female) trout typically build their nests (called ["redds"](https://fishingweekendwarrior.com/information/a-comprehensive-guide-to-rainbow-trout-spawning/)) in gravel stream beds, I've taken the initiative to construct mine in digital form. Female trout are known to carefully inspect potential nesting sites before choosing their mate - and I encourage similar scrutiny of my [dating doc](/date-me).[^trout] 

[^trout]: I'm not a marine biologist. I looked around and gave the trout mating claims a quick check - they don't seem obviously wrong. 

# Transparency in reasoning and predicting
I've [criticized the loose analogical reasoning which permeates the "rationalist" community's AI risk arguments](/danger-of-suggestive-terminology). But criticism is cheap. I hold myself to my own high standards.

> The poorest way to face life is to face it with a sneer. There are many men who feel a kind of twister pride in cynicism; there are many who confine themselves to criticism of the way others do what they themselves dare not even attempt. There is no more unhealthy being, no man less worthy of respect, than he who either really holds, or feigns to hold, an attitude of sneering disbelief toward all that is great and lofty, whether in achievement or in that noble effort which, even if it fails, comes to second achievement. A cynical habit of thought and speech, a readiness to criticize work which the critic himself never tries to perform, an intellectual aloofness which will not accept contact with life's realities - all these are marks, not as the possessor would fain to think, of superiority but of weakness. They mark the men unfit to bear their part painfully in the stern strife of living, who seek, in the affection of contempt for the achievements of others, to hide from others and from themselves in their own weakness. The r√¥le is easy; there is none easier, save only the r√¥le of the man who sneers alike at both criticism and performance.
> 
> It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

I hope to speak loudly and carry a small ego. I want to enjoy my wins and honorably acknowledge my mis-predictions. 

## Bounty for bad analogies I've made since 2022
Analogies can be useful; analogies can be deadly. For an analogy to be useful, it has to highlight how two analogous situations _share the relevant mechanisms._ For example, an [analog computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_computer) obeys the same differential equations as certain harmonic oscillators. By "reasoning" using the "analogy" of an electrical circuit with such-and-such voltages and resistances, we can accurately predict physical systems of pendulums and springs:
 ![](https://assets.turntrout.com/static/images/posts/computer-analogy.avif)
 
 However, in AI alignment, folks seem to be less careful. Does "evolution" "finding" the human genome tell us anything about the difficulty of "inner alignment" in "selection processes"? What are the proposed mechanisms? I think that I am more careful - and that I have been for a while.

> [!money] $50 bounty for analogies without mechanistic support
> 
> Criteria:
> 1. The analogy was made since July 7, 2022. That's when I posted [Human values & biases are inaccessible to the genome](https://turntrout.com/human-values-and-biases-are-inaccessible-to-the-genome).
> 2. The analogy is in a post on `turntrout.com`.
> 3. The analogy is not supported by mechanistic justification because no such justification exists.
> 
> If your claim meets the criteria, I will also credit your name on a list - alongside the called-out analogy. I will comment how I changed my mind as a result of realizing I gave a weak argument. Lastly, if the analogy lacks mechanistic justification _but_ such a justification exists, I will pay $10 and edit the article.

> To claim your bounty, [submit your find.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScEePeMdZREtCkbk9J5fKfB9x6li-aHlecvSAbj6TyAub7jMw/viewform?usp=sf_link)

Each post states when it was published and when it was last updated. The updated link points to the file on [my GitHub repo](https://github.com/alexander-turner/TurnTrout.com) where the edit history can be inspected. 

Ideally, readers would be able to zero-trust verify that I haven't e.g. expunged embarrassing statements from my `git` history. However, `git` defaults to the SHA-1 hashing algorithm. Given a fixed SHA-1 hash, [it's practical to find multiple files which map to that hash](https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html). However, suppose I write embarrassing statement $X$ (I know this may be hard to imagine, but imagine anyways). $X$ has the SHA-1 hash $\mathrm{hash}(X)$. To cover my tracks without violating the previously published SHA-1 hash, I'd need to find another statement $X'$ such that $\mathrm{hash}(X')=\mathrm{hash}(X)$ (a ["second-preimage" attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preimage_attack)).[^second] [Apparently no one knows how to do this](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/103061/how-secure-is-sha-1-against-preimage-attacks-currently), which means you should probably just trust the `git` hash history.[^caveat]

[^second]: Not only would I need to find a second preimage for $\mathrm{hash(X)}$, I'd need to deal with the fact that the later commits hash the prior commits (and so would require an entire chain of fakery).

[^caveat]: I could also restart the chain of commits from an older commit, but that'd require giving up all work and modifications performed since that commit. 

## Fatebook prediction tracking

<iframe src="https://fatebook.io/embed/q/are-you-going-to-like-turntrout-com---cm2u10nym00029cc3j1h05pot?compact=true&requireSignIn=false" height="200"></iframe>

By embedding [`Fatebook.io`](https://fatebook.io) predictions, I get the benefits of [PredictionBook](https://predictionbook.com/) without the clunkiness. Fatebook embeds show how my beliefs change over time and overall encourage me to make more ‚ú®falsifiable predictions‚ú®. 

# The future
Over the last few years, my life has lost a certain touch of magic - a touch of _[aspiration to do better](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Nu3wa6npK4Ry66vFp/a-sense-that-more-is-possible)_ and of _excitement to not be doing it alone._  I will speak more of this de-magicking. For now, I say: May this site bring back a touch of magic.
